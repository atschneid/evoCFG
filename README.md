# evoCFG

Trying to uncover DCG rules for arbitrary grammars using genetic programming.

This is a work in progress. Requires SWI-Prolog and swipl to run.

For testing, define your CFG using prolog DCG rules in the file ``real_rules.pl``, list your terminals, tab separated, in the file ``term.tsv``. Then run ``cfg_example.py``. Good Luck! :-)
